    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis is the accompnanying web-book for the FOSS4G 2025 talk. Slides for the talk are available in the Github repo.\nThere are many ways to explore urban form using digital methods. The one we’ll delve into is the analysis of urban character via data science approaches coined as “spatial typologies”: one part of the dual approach of spatial signatures that combines form (typologies) and function.\n\nThe spatial signatures are thus a delineation that divides geographical space based on its appearance (form) and how it is used (function)[1].\n\nSpatial typologies are generated from from many different metrics that describe the structure of urban space. In this talk, we will start simple: deriving typologies of two New Zealand cities (Auckland and Wellington) using structural characteristics alone. While this will only be covered briefly, the value of spatial typologies and its extension to signatures goes beyond an interesting exercise with FOSS and can be especially relevant in urban planning.\n\nFor policy-makers, the spatial signatures provide a framework for detailed spatial understanding of the cities and territories their decisions affect. They are useful both in the global north, where cities are constantly recast and retrofitted, as well as the global south, where most of the new urbanisation is currently taking place [1].\n\nThe code to generate spatial typologies uses the Python package momepy [2] and mostly replicates the guide “Simplified detection of urban types”. I’ve extented the use case to New Zealand cities with datasets in the Github repo for convenience. I’ve also tried to explain the approach taken in the package guide as well as describing the derived typologies and their potential consequences for Wellington and Auckland. While the majority of the code is in Python, visualisations have been done in R.\nPreparing this talk has been an enjoyable learning experience for me and I hope it helps others on their journey in exploring cities with the power of FOSS4G. Time permitting, it’s my hope that the introductory work covered here will be extended in the future.\n\n\n\n\n[1] D. Arribas-Bel and M.

    "text": "The most common and tractable analysis of urban form is through study of visualisations like figure-ground diagrams. Below we see figure-ground of three Auckland suburbs: Ponsonby, East Tāmaki and Grey Lynn. With no prior knowledge we can easily surmise that Grey Lynn and Ponsonby are largely residential suburbs with a strong grid layout while East Tāmaki is a mixed area with large buildings in the western part - mostly likely industrial given their large footprint and inter-building separation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe street network is another structural element we can consider though here it’s harder to draw conclusions since the area covered by each plot is not the same. Visual comparisons are best done on the same scale. With different area covered by each subplot it’s not possible to say that the eastern part of East Tāmaki has a more concentrated street layout compared to the other suburbs. Already we’re against a limitation of visual methods: getting the scale is crucial and comparison studies of differently sized areas (like suburbs) are not easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing geometries to metrics helps us move away from the area constraint. Here we see every street network linestrings summarised into a bearing angle (with North being 0\\(^{\\deg}\\)). Now we can easily tell that Ponsonby has a very strong rectangular grid layout while Grey Lynn looks like a grid arrangement but the streets are oriented across many different angles. Again, not obviously so but East Tāmaki has an underlying grid for some major street segments but also many smaller streets that are spread across all angles.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In Chapter 2 we saw that going from a geometry visualisation to a metric of bearings was able to pull out considerable insight even though it was a single summary of a complex geometry. Morphometrics pull out increasing complex representations out of simple geometries like buildings and polygons. The momepy suite [1] has an exhaustive set of dimensional as well as contextual metrics that summarise the polygon and line geometries of urban structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dimensions that can be derived from buildings and streets increase our understanding beyond simple figure-ground diagrams and street orientation plots. But buildings and streets are only two aspects of urban structure. Higher order structures like blocks and plots (parcels) offer deeper insight and more complex metrics that can be used to better describe urban character.\nInstead of adding another dataset heavy dataset of land plots / parcels, momepy has a clever “morphological tessellation” algorithm that creates an approximation of a plot. The tessellation cell is a boundary around every building created in a way that equally repels nearby cells. Once derived from the buildings dataset, it can be used for complex morphometrics like covered area ratio (CAR).\n\n“.. the morphological cell, its smallest spatial unit which delineates the portion of land around each building that is closer to it than to any other but no further than 100 m. As such, the morphological tessellation captures the topological relations between individual cells and influence that each building exerts on the surrounding space.”\n\nThe tessellation cell is also the core unit for the clustering algorithm used to identify urban typologies. Morphometrics derived from buildings and streets are mapped onto the tessellation cell in addition to metrics derived from the tessellation itself like the covered area and neighbours metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother higher order structure is ‘blocks’. Blocks in momepy are constructed by dissolving the tessellation cell to polygons constructed from street geometries. Blocks are a useful entity for visualisations and stories that connect well with urbanism narratives. momepy manages IDs between tessellation, buildings and blocks making it easy to choose the appropriate entity for visualising morphometrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last piece in generating morphometrics for discovering urban typologies is going from dimensional to contextual metrics. If we take the convexity metric derived from the tessellation cell, we see that generating it for each cell (RHS) has a mosaic pattern where adjacent cells can have very different values. Contextual metrics smooth out using the percentiles from the neighbourhood of adjacent cells. This is done by abstracting the geometries (e.g. tessellation polygons) into a spatial graph to find nearest neighbours one or N steps away. There is a great introduction to spatial graphs on the Spatial Data Science for Social Geography (SDS4SG) course by the author of the momepy package [2].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "We’re now ready to combine all the derived morphometrics into a simple algorithm clusters tessellation cells that are similar. The identified clusters represent a spatial typology for the area we’re studying. The main idea of unsupervised clustering is that we don’t have a pre-determined idea of how many clusters we expect. Instead, we try many different options and use quantitative metrics to choose the one where members of the cluster are both more similar to each other, and clusters are well separated.\nQuantitative metrics can be used in two main ways: we can use visual inspection of a very useful tool called a “clustergram” to qualitatively evaluate which clustering option is the most stable and we can use the pattern in scores and use the cluster value of the minimum or maximum score depending on the metric.\nLet’s start with the clustergram. This visualisation shows that there is an initial stable set of clusters (2-5) and then another stable set of splits from around 7-10 clusters. While useful to see how the tessellation cells get split and which ones move to different clusters, it’s hard to identify the best cluster number from this alone for Wellington.\n\nThe ideal case does not exist. We ultimately need to make a decision on the optimal number of clusters. Clustergam gives us additional insights into what happens between different options, how it splits. [1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo let’s try a common clustering metric: the Davies-Bouldin (D-B) score. This score measures cluster compactness against cluster separation. The best cluster number is one where the D-B score is minimised. For Wellington, there is a clear winner: 5 clusters.\n\nCluster compactness: How close data points are to the center of their own cluster.\nCluster separation: How far apart different clusters are from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we plot the cluster assignment, we can see it matches our contextual understanding of the city. Note, cluster 3 is an artefact of the TLA bounding box and is actually outside Wellington City boundaries.\nFor those familiar with Wellington, we can see how the typologies match its quirks:\n\nflat areas mostly adjacent to the city centre e.g. Newtown (cluster 2)\nsuburbs on the hills (cluster 1)\na high density CBD (cluster 4)\nindustrial areas e.g. Ngauranga and Kaiwharawhara (cluster 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the advantages of this city-wide clustering is its identification of similar urban typologies beyond our contextual understanding. For example, there are several more areas around Wellington that are similar to Newtown: Karori, Miramar, Island Bay and Berhampore as well as “village centres” that are typically on ridges or plateaus in the surrounding hilly suburbia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the “flat and accessible” typology is much more prevalent across the south of Wellington, we can expect increased growth here and opportunities for creating higher density housing by enabling a highly connected city via public transport and cycling lanes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clustering approach has only used a subset of the available metrics in momepy. Detailed analysis of typologies should incorporate more contextual metrics. Deriving spatial signatures (combining form and function) [2] would be a highly valuable output for use with urban planning.\n\n\n\n\n[1] “Introduction to Clustergram — clustergram.” https://clustergram.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/introduction.html (accessed Nov. 13, 2025).\n\n\n[2] D.

    "title": "5  Auckland typologies",
    "section": "",
    "text": "As the largest city in New Zealand by both area and population, the urban complexity of Auckland is fascinating to study. The approach is the same as that done for Wellington but the memory requirements are considerably greater. The code runs within a few minutes on an M2 Macbook Pro with 16 GB RAM but less powerful laptops might struggle. If that is the case, feel free to adjust the bounding box of Auckland OR run the code on a more specced out cloud computer.\nLike Wellington, the extent of Auckland is limited to “urban Auckland” using the urban/rural geographies defined by Statistics New Zealand. This is especially helpful for Auckland as the TLA and region are considerably larger than the urban extent and classifying rural typologies doesn’t add much to the insights for the corresponding increase in computational effort.\nFollowing the same approach as Wellington with the clustergram (not shown here) and the Davies-Bouldin score we find a convenient “sweet spot” set of 14 clusters for Auckland. While the cluster decision was relatively easier for Wellington, we need to make a more considered choice for Auckland. This is often the case for unsupervised clustering where a clear winner is not always found [1].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting 15 clusters on a single map doesn’t show the typologies as clearly but we can get into the details by subsetting the data: either by suburb or by cluster type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Chapter 2 we questioned if the residential areas within three Auckland suburbs are likely to be similar? Our clustering algorithm shows that only the block layouts of Ponsonby and Grey Lynn are the same typology while the curvilinear streets and cul-de-sacs of the residential part of East Tāmaki belong to a completely different cluster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchical clustering is a clever little technique to see how closely connected the different typologies. It is a rough estimate as it only separates clusters using the mean value of all the morphometrics but we can pick out some interesting insights. First thing we see is a connection back to biology: a phylogenetic tree of how different species came to be. Here, we can interpret the dendrogram as typologies that are split close together are more similar than ones further way. Finding the specific metrics that generate the splits in the tree would be an interesting future analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can summarise suburbs in Auckland by their most dominant typology. Note, we’re only listing suburbs with more than 100 buildings. Some suburbs, like Takapuna have a dominant typology that only represents a small fraction of buildings because it has many other typologies within its boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\ncluster\nbuildings_in_cluster\ntotal_buildings\ncluster_fraction\n\n\n\n\nAlbany\n5\n1173\n2742\n0.4277899\n\n\nAlbany

look at the distribution of the clusters that Grey Lynn, Ponsonby and Auckland Central belong to. They are clearly the minority in the city!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, if we look at the distribution of typologies belonging to some newer parts of Auckland like Albany and East Tāmaki Heights, we see that they are popular beyond the suburb and dominate in specific parts of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] “Introduction to Clustergram — clustergram.” https://clustergram.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/introduction.html (accessed Nov. 13, 2025).",
